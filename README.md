# Customer Segmentation using K-Means

Welcome to the Customer Segmentation project! This project aims to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation helps businesses understand their customer base better and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Introduction

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics. This project leverages the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers, enabling businesses to target specific customer groups more effectively.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and scaling customer data.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Applying the K-Means algorithm to segment customers.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing the customer segments using various plots.
- **Customizable**: Easily adjust the number of clusters and other parameters.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab account (optional but recommended)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git
   cd customer-segmentation
   ```

2. Open the project in Google Colab:

   - Upload the `customer_segmentation.ipynb` notebook to your Google Drive.
   - Open the notebook in Google Colab.

3. Install required dependencies:

   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Load and Preprocess Data**:

   Load the dataset and preprocess it (cleaning, scaling).

2. **Apply K-Means Clustering**:

   Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment the customers.

3. **Visualize the Segments**:

   Use plots to visualize the different customer segments.

4. **Analyze the Results**:

   Interpret the results to understand the characteristics of each customer segment.

Detailed instructions for each step are provided in the `customer_segmentation.ipynb` notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Mall Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) from Kaggle. It contains information about customers, including:

- Customer ID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income
- Spending Score

## Model Architecture

The project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm for customer segmentation. The number of clusters (K) can be adjusted to find the optimal segmentation. The algorithm groups customers based on their similarities in the dataset.

## Results

The project segments customers into distinct groups, which can be visualized using scatter plots and other visualization techniques. Detailed results and visualizations are provided in the notebook.
